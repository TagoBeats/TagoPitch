// Fit the fixed design canvas to whatever viewport the host hands us.
//
// The UI is drawn on a fixed 560x360 canvas (see #plugin in App.css). Hosts do
// not reliably give the editor that exact size: with display scaling the WebView
// viewport ends up smaller in CSS pixels (560 / 1.25 = 448), and some hosts
// simply hand over a different window. Without this the page keeps its 560x360
// and the right and bottom edges are cut off behind `overflow: hidden`.
//
// Reported 24.09.2026 for Cakewalk Sonar and Fender Studio Pro, reproducible
// with `node scripts/ui_size_check.mjs 448 288`.
//
// Scaling the whole canvas keeps the approved layout intact at any size, and it
// is what makes the editor resizable: the host may pick any window on the design
// aspect ratio and the UI follows.

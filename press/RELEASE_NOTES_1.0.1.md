# TagoPitch 1.0.1

Fixes a cut-off interface on hosts that apply display scaling, and makes the
plugin window resizable.

## Fixed

- **Interface cut off in some hosts.** On hosts that hand the plugin a window
  smaller than the interface, most often because of Windows or macOS display
  scaling above 100%, the right column and the bottom edge were cut off. The
  interface now scales into whatever window the host gives it. Reported on
  Cakewalk Sonar and Fender Studio Pro.

## Added

- **Resizable window.** Drag the plugin window to any size you like. The aspect
  ratio stays locked, and the size is saved with the project.

## Install

- **macOS 11+:** run the `.pkg` and pick the formats you want (AU + VST3,
  notarized).
- **Windows:** unzip and drop the `.vst3` into your VST3 folder.

Settings and presets from 1.0.0 carry over unchanged.
